#STATEFUL CARDS
### stately cards


A simulation of playing cards in vanilla python, with lifelike 
shuffling, cutting, etc, for use in place of a real deck. cards' state 
stored across sessions so the deck remains the same kind of shuffled 
across sessions. 

------

### to-do and timeline

1. ~~basic proof-of-concept: cards as a data structure, verb functions, loading and saving functions.~~
2. ~~python package and different card decks (tarot, oracle, etc.)~~ mostly done, haven't tested yet
3. ~~interactive shell~~ MOVED to different project
4. ~~interactive shell w/ "code completion"~~ MOVED

### next steps

- testing, testing.
- set up ArdenShell when run as script (for `python -m ArdenCards` interactive fun) 
- package for pip and deploy 
- python3 support?? ‾\\\_(ツ)\_/‾
